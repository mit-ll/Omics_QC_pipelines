## Instructions

1) Please build the [qc_base] container first before proceeding.

2) Build NRSscATACseq.def: 

    singularity build NRSscATACseq.sif NRSscATACseq.def

3) Put your input data files in the "io/" directory.

4) Build scATACseq.def: 

    singularity build scATACseq.sif scATACseq.def

5) Run the container built in Step 6 by typing:
    ```
    singularity run -B io/:/io/ scATACseq.sif -1 <read_file1> [options]
    ```
   Output generated by the pipeline will be stored in the "io/" directory.

## Parameter options

	    -1 <string>    The first input read filename (required option; don't type io/<filename>)

	    -2 <string>    The second input read filename (only if paired-end)

	    -t <int>       The number of threads (default = 16)

	    -h             Print this help message

# Metrics
```
    Fraction of total read pairs mapped confidently to genome (frac_mapped_confidently)
    frac_cut_fragments_in_peaks(%)
    Mean trimmed sequence length
```
