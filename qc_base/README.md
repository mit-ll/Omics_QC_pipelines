## Overview

This recipe is the base recipe for all the ECHO pipelines to be built on top of. This container should be built first, as it contains the basic software for each pipeline.

Once built, this container will have:

 * Java
 * Miniconda
 * R
 * Other supporting software, such as GCC, Git, wget, make, etc.
 * Several R packages

This recipe does not need to be built before building every single pipeline; it only has to be built once.

To build: 

    singularity build qc_base.sif qc_base.def
