## Build Instructions

1) Please build the [qc_base] container first before proceeding.

2) Build NRSmedip_seq.def: 

    singularity build NRSmedip_seq.sif NRSmedip_seq.def

3) Put your input data files in the "io/" directory.

4) Build MeDIP_seq.def: 

    singularity build MeDIP_seq.sif MeDIP_seq.def

## Run Options

    Run the container with:
    ```
    singularity run -B io/:/io/ MeDIP_seq.sif -1 <read_file1> [options]
    ```
  Output generated by the pipeline will be stored in the "io/" directory.

	    -1 <string>    The first input read filename (required option; don't type io/<filename>)

	    -2 <string>    The second input read filename (only if paired-end)

	    -t <int>       The number of threads (default = 16)

	    -h             Print help message

## Metrics
```
    Sequencing depth
    CpG sites coverage
    Mean trimmed sequence length
```
