## Instructions

1) Please build the [qc_base] container first before proceeding.

2) Build NRSepic.def: 

    singularity build NRSepic.sif NRSepic.def

3) Build epic.def: 

    singularity build epic.sif epic.def or
    singularity build --sandbox epic epic.def

4) Run the container built in Step 4 by typing:
    ```
    singularity run -B <experiment>/:/io/ epic.sif -d <EPIC data directory>
    singularity run -B 20210707_101234_MSSA_DU_PBMC_epic:/io/ -d epic.sif DU19-01S0003509_5

    Sandbox version:
    singularity run -B <experiment>/:/io/ epic/ -d <EPIC data directory>
    ```
   Output generated by the pipeline will be stored in the "io/<EPIC data directory>" directory.

## Metrics
