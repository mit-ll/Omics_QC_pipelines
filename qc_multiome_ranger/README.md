## Instructions

1. Please build the base container first before proceeding.

2. Build NRSmultiome.def: 

    singularity build NRSmultiome.sif NRSmultiome.def

3. Put your input data files in the "io/" directory.

4. Build multiome_ranger.def: 

    singularity build multiome_ranger.sif multiome_ranger.def

5. Run the container by typing:

    	singularity run -B io/:/io/ multiome_ranger.sif -d <directory> -a <fastq1a-scATAC> -r <fastq1g-scRNA> -t 1

   Output generated by the pipeline will be stored in the "io/" directory.

### Run options
```
    -d  Directory name
    -s  Sample name
    -a  scATAC-seq folder name
    -r  scRNA-seq folder name
    -t  number of threads
```
## Metrics scATAC-seq
```
    Fraction of total read pairs mapped confidently to genome (frac_mapped_confidently)
    frac_cut_fragments_in_peaks(%)
    Mean trimmed sequence length
```
## Metrics scRNA-seq
```
    Estimated number of cells
    Median UMI per cell
    Reads mapped to exons (%exon)
    Fraction reads in cells (frac_cells)
    %cells with mitochondrial reads >= 20%
    Mean trimmed sequence length
```
