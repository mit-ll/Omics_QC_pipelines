## Instructions

1) Please build the [qc_base] container first before proceeding.

2) Build NRSatac-seq.def: 

    singularity build NRSatac-seq.sif NRSatac-seq.def

3) Put your input data files in the "io/" directory.

4) Build atac-seq.def: 

    singularity build atac-seq.sif atac-seq.def

5) Run the container by typing:
    ```
    singularity run -B io/:/io/ atac-seq.sif -1 <read_file1> [options]
    ```
   Output generated by the pipeline will be stored in the "io/" directory.

## Parameter options

	    -1 <string>    The first input read filename (required option)

	    -2 <string>    The second input read filename (only if paired-end)

	    -t <int>       The number of threads (default = 16)

	    -h             Print this help message

## Metrics computed
```
    Sequencing depth
    Aligned reads
    Nodup_flagstat_qc
    overlap_frip_qc
    NFR peak detected
    Presence of mononucleosomal peak detected
    TSS enrichment score
    Mean trimmed sequence length
```
